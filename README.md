# Breast-Tumor-Classification
A Machine Learning project for Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression.   Trained on the sklearn breast cancer dataset and deployed with Gradio for an interactive web app.   The model predicts whether a tumor is Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous) based on 30 medical features.

# Breast Cancer Detection Model

This is a simple Logistic Regression model trained on the sklearn breast cancer dataset.
Deployed with Gradio for easy web interaction.
